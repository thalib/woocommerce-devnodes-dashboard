# Devnodes Dashboard Widget for Wordpress & Woocommerce

This is a simple WordPress plugin that displays all users created in your WordPress/WooCommerce installation. It creates a widget in the WordPress dashboard that shows the total number of users, the number of users in each role, and a list of all users with the administrator role. This makes it easy to monitor the admin user list and check for any suspicious activity, such as role elevation or unauthorized access.
